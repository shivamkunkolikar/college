Algorithms

(1) Insertion Sort
    Step 1 : Start
    Step 2 : Start traversing array from 1 location to n'th location
    Step 3 : During each pass take i'th element and and start travesing backwards
    Step 4 : Shift All elements greater than i'th element to right until it is 
             less than the i'th element.
    Step 5 : Place the i'th element at that location.
    Step 6 : Goto i+1'th location and repeat from step 3 until n'th location
    Step 7 : Stop

(2) Merge Sort
    Step 1 : Start
    Step 2 : If number of elements in the list is 1 than return that element 
    Step 3 : else Divide the list in two halves.
    Step 4 : Repeat all steps from Step 2 for 1'st list
    Step 5 : Repeat all steps from step 2 for 2'nd list
    Step 6 : Merge both the lists
    Step 7 : Stop

(3) Quick Sort 
    Step 1 : Start
    Step 2 : Take first element as pivot element
    Step 3 : Divide array into 2 halves such that elements less than pivot
             elements are placed before pivot elements and greater are placed 
             after pivot elements
    Step 4 : Repeat All steps from Step 2 for both sub-arrays.
    Step 5 : Stop
